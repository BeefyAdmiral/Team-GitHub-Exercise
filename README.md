# Team GitHub Exercise

- In this exercise, our group came up with a small programming project in order to test our knowledge on GitHub, create a workflow we can use on our client project, and get used to an agile software development environment. 
- Our project contains a variety of basic math functions, where the user can input some integers and get a corresponding output based on the operation being performed.

## Feature Description

- summation(): adds all given numbers together and returns the sum
- product(): multiplies all given numbers together and returns the product
- power(): takes two integers and then calculates/returns the result, where the first int is the base and second int is the power

## How to Use

- Sum & Product: After running the python file in the command line, you will be prompted to enter any number of positive integers, and to enter after each number. To complete your stream of numbers, enter 0. You will then be prompted to choose whether to get the SUM of the numbers, or the PRODUCT. Entering either will result in the corresponding answer being returned.
- Power: After running the python file in the command line, you will be prompted to enter two positive integers, and enter after each number. Once the two numbers are entered, the answer will be returned.
